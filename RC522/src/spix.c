	 *  Bit 4 â€“ MSTR: Master/Slave Select
	 *  This bit selects Master SPI mode when written to one, and Slave SPI
	 *  mode when written logic zero. If SS is config-ured as an input and 
	 *  is driven low while MSTR is set, MSTR will be cleared, and SPIF in 
	 *  SPSR will become set.The user will then have to set MSTR to 
	 *  re-enable SPI Master mode.
	 *
	 * Well FUCK. Please leave the SPI_SS in here.
